## Memory Game
Built a tech memory game using vanilla javascript and vanilla CSS

#### Aplication Sctructure
<ul>
  <li>
    game.js: creates the game objetc, and manage the rules of the game
  </li>
  <li>
    script.js: manages the game inferface. Used a trick with CSS animation to flip the cards {transform: rotateY(180deg)}, and {backface-visibility: hidden}. That being said, script.js is able to flip cards by toggling the '.flip' CSS class on elements.
  </li>
</ul>
